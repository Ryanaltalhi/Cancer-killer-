### Brain Tumor Detection System

This project aims to develop a brain tumor detection system using TensorFlow, Python, CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. The system will leverage machine learning techniques to assist medical professionals in accurately identifying brain tumors from MRI images.

### Features:

1. **MRI Image Input**: Users can upload MRI images of the brain for analysis.
2. **Preprocessing**: The system preprocesses the input images to enhance features relevant to tumor detection.
3. **TensorFlow Model**: Utilizes a pre-trained TensorFlow model for brain tumor detection.
4. **Real-time Detection**: Provides real-time feedback on whether a tumor is detected in the uploaded image.
5. **User-friendly Interface**: Designed with an intuitive user interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for easy interaction.

### Technologies Used:

- **TensorFlow**: For building and training the brain tumor detection model.
- **Python**: Backend development and integration of TensorFlow model.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Frontend development for the user interface.
- **MRI Image Processing Libraries**: Libraries for image preprocessing and manipulation.
